#' @description This dataset contains annual occupancy estimates for 45 species of dragonflies and damselflies in the UK, 1970-2015.
#' There are 2039 rows: 44 species have an estimate for every year, but the Small red-eyed damselfly (Erythromma viridulum) has no estimates prior to 2001 (the first year in which it was recorded in UK).
#' The models are based on biological records data from the British Dragonfly Society.
#' The data are derived from Bayesian occupancy detection models, described in Outhwaite et al (2019).

#' There are six columns of data:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\code{"species"}} {The species' name (Latin binomial)}
#'  \item{\code{"year"}} {year to which the index value refers (integer)}
#'  \item{\code{"occupancy"}} {A national index of occupancy, defined as the proportion of occupied 1 km grid cells.}
#'  \item{\code{"index"}} {The national index of occupancy on the logit (log odds) scale.}
#'  \item{\code{"se"}} {Standard error of the posterior distribution of logit occupancy}
#'  \item{\code{"inAtlas"}} {Logical. Identifies the 38 the species was included in the 2014 Atlas of Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland.}
